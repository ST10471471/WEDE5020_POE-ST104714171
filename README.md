ORGANISATION OVERVIEW

NAME: FRAGRANCE WORLD PERFUMES
	Fragrance World Perfumes was founded by MR. Lunga Watts and his brother MR. Sihle Watts in SOUTH AFRICA in 2024 with the aim and vision of creating and providing high-quality luxury fragrances for our local and abroad customers.	

MISSION AND VISION STATEMENT
	Mission Statement: Our mission is to craft a variety of perfect, high-quality fragrances that will suit every occasion for every customer. 
Vision statement: Our vision as FRAGRANCE WORLD PERFUMES is to be one of the biggest fragrance Company, not just in South Africa but globally as we look forward to expanding our business to different countries so that our products will be available everywhere and easily accessible.  
(PRODUCTION, 2021) 
TARGET AUDIENCE

	Our natural ingredients (Essential oils, Plant extracts, Resins and Balsams) that we use are user friendly which means that everyone including infants can use our products. FRAGRANCE WORLD PERFUMES offers any kind of fragrances which means that everyone who enters our store will have something that will fully satisfy him/her.

	Please note that our baby fragrances have a lower fragrance oil concentration with a percentage of 1-3% which means that they are very suitable for babies they cannot cause any health issues such as skin irritation.
 
(PRODUCTION, 2021)





 WEBSITE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

	We are looking forward to increasing our website traffic by using our currently existing business social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) because people now spend some of their free time to visit different social media platforms for different reasons. We can use our social media as an opportunity to advertise our products that we have because potential customers or future customers might come across our products while scrolling on social media.

 
(Blomkvist, 2021)

 
 KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

	SALES: From the day we opened our first physical store we managed to gain more than 1 000 customers. In a day we sell about 50+ products, I believe that we can sell more if we have a fully functioning website because some customers do not have time to visit our store they prefer to buy online while sitting comfortably in their homes.

	MARKETING: I believe that we have marketed our products well on our social media platforms because 80% of customers that walk into our store say they have seen us on social media, and they love how we present our products to them. The good thing here is that we used free advertising on social media to gain customers. We are also looking forward to having billboards around once we have a website.

	CUSTOMER SERVICE: It looks like our customers are very happy with our in-store service and with our products because we’ve got good reviews on our social media pages.
 In our store we have an assistant that crafts special fragrances for customers that want a unique scent of their choice.

	HUMAN RESOURCE: When we first opened our store, we had 5 employees in total but now we have 20 employees in total. All our employees have good knowledge about fragrances so there was no need for a training.
