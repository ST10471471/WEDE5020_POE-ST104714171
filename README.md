 WEBSITE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

	We are looking forward to increasing our website traffic by using our currently existing business social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) because people now spend some of their free time to visit different social media platforms for different reasons. We can use our social media as an opportunity to advertise our products that we have because potential customers or future customers might come across our products while scrolling on social media.

 KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

	SALES: From the day we opened our first physical store we managed to gain more than 1 000 customers. In a day we sell about 50+ products, I believe that we can sell more if we have a fully functioning website because some customers do not have time to visit our store they prefer to buy online while sitting comfortably in their homes.

	MARKETING: I believe that we have marketed our products well on our social media platforms because 80% of customers that walk into our store say they have seen us on social media, and they love how we present our products to them. The good thing here is that we used free advertising on social media to gain customers. We are also looking forward to having billboards around once we have a website.

	CUSTOMER SERVICE: It looks like our customers are very happy with our in-store service and with our products because we’ve got good reviews on our social media pages.
 In our store we have an assistant that crafts special fragrances for customers that want a unique scent of their choice.

	HUMAN RESOURCE: When we first opened our store, we had 5 employees in total but now we have 20 employees in total. All our employees have good knowledge about fragrances so there was no need for a training.
